Final project for ENGG 233, an introductory coding course for engineers. The class was done using Processing, a software that uses simplified Java for coding.

The final project consisted of using file I/O to read weather information for Calgary, Alberta over several years and using the Swing library to create a GUI for bar 
graphs and scatter plots. GUI buttons were also utilized for additional functionalities, including:
 - Allowing users to switch between scatter plots and bar graphs
 - Allowing users to specify a date range for weather statistics
 - Only showing positive or negative temperatures
 - Showing weather statistics for a selected month (ex. only for September)
 - Show statistics for snow fall (in centimeters)
 - Showing maximum or minimum temperatures
