/* I decided to program drawing The Sword in the Stone, otherewise known as Excalibur, because I'm very interested in ancient histories. British
history of King Aruthur is protrayed in many different types of media including TV shows, movies, video games and novels. I enjoy reading into
history and mythological stories such as the sword in the stone. There are also games such as the Legend of Zelda that reference King Arthur's pulling
of the sword from the stone (except Link from that game doesn't become king). The pulling of the sword from the stone is a well-known event, so I
thought it wouldn't be difficult to explain. */
